#### Vitruvius

In homage to the first users of concrete in ancient times, the 2005/2006 team adopted a Roman theme. Vitruvius was a vaunted engineer for Julius Caesar, and his namesake canoe encapsulates the elegant form and strength distinctive of Ancient Roman engineering. Some of the most extensive concrete testing was conducted to determine the optimal mix proportions, while computational modeling was used to design and analyze the hull's final shape. The year was capped off with toga clad teammates cheering on our paddlers and presenters at the finals in Sherbrooke, Quebec.

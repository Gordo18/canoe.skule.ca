#### Ecto-2

This canoe aint afraid of no ghost! Ecto-2, the first canoe made by UofT with white cement, stood out amongst the other canoes at the competition because of it. With a hull chosen from thousands of analyzed designs, and a total weight (lightest at the competition) of 157 lbs, Ecto-2 was also a work of technical excellence. The competition at Queen's university was a tremendous success, with UofT sending its biggest team in years, along with Blue and Gold arriving to cheer UofT on.

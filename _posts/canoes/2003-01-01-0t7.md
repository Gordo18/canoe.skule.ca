#### Classified

The emerald green Nikko was named for the king of the Flying Monkeys in the Wizard of Oz. A loose fibre reinforcement in the concrete mix resulted in a slightly fuzzy surface but greatly increased resilience compared to previous canoes. The competition in Moncton included a presentation with appearances by Dorothy, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the Scarecrow.

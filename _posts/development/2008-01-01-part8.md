Alright, nothing shows more Skule spirit than knowing the songs of The Lady Godiva Memorial Bnad associated with your favourite clubs. Here we present the song(s) and verses of Concrete Canoe!

#### Marching Canoes
(To the tune of ["Marching Bands"](http://lgmb.skule.ca/))

> When canoes and concrete fall in line,  
> We've got to build a bridge another time.  
> And for the mix I yell, yell, yell, yell, yell,  
> And for the hull design I yell, I yell like hell.  
> We're going to stroke, stroke, stroke, for every yard,  
> Circle the buoys and hit the water hard,  
> And throw the paddlers upon the surf!  
> (GET 'N FIRST)  
> WOO! WOO! WOO!

#### Ox and concrete
(To the tune of ["Godiva's Hymn"](http://lgmb.skule.ca/))

> The Romans fed their concrete mix the blood of ox and men
> The Mafia uses theirs to teach a lesson now and then
> But for all their pretty tricks their evil cannot even tie
> Our trusting it in a canoe to float and keep us dry!

#### Many ways
(Also to the tune of ["Godiva's Hymn"](http://lgmb.skule.ca/))

> Any Civil Engineer can go for days and days  
> Describing how concrete's used in oh-so many ways,  
> But not till one dark gray night of true debauchery  
> Was using it to float a boat considered one of these!

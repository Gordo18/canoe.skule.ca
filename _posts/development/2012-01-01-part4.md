Our canoe’s are composed of three main layers: finishing, structural, and carbon fibre mesh.

The finishing layer act as a sacrificial layer that allow us to easily sand the canoe down. The structural layers is made of a strong and dense concrete to provide the majority of the canoe’s strength. The fibre mesh adds more strength to the concrete while adding in very little size and mass.

The first layer put down in the mold is the finishing layer which is around 2-3mm thick which is followed with a 4mm thick structural layer. A carbon fiber mesh is then laid atop the two layers. Afterwards, another set of structural and finishing layers are placed over the mesh. This layering ensures a structural core with the sacrificial finishing layers on both the inside and the outside of the canoe.

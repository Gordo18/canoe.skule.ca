Alright, nothing shows more Skule spirit than knowing the songs and verses of Godiva's Hymn associated with your favourite clubs. Here we present the song(s) and verses of Concrete Canoe!

This first song follows the tune of another SkuleT song, Marching Bands (check your F!rosh handbook):

**When canoes and concrete fall in line,**
**We've got to build a bridge another time.**
**And for the mix I yell, yell, yell, yell, yell,**
**And for the hull design I yell, I yell like hell.**
**We're going to stroke, stroke, stroke, for every yard,**
**Circle the buoys and hit the water hard,**
**And throw the paddlers upon the surf!**
**(GET 'N FIRST)**
**WOO! WOO! WOO!**

Okay, easy as pie right? (ha, get it? pie!) These next two verses are from Godiva's Hymn, be sure to share them with your fellow SkuleTM mates whenever possible (oh and if you're first reaction to Godiva's Hymn is "who's what!?" then seriously, open your F!rosh handbook):

**The Romans fed their concrete mix the blood of ox and men**
**The Mafia uses theirs to teach a lesson now and then**
**But for all their pretty tricks their evil cannot even tie**
**Our trusting it in a canoe to float and keep us dry!**

**Any Civil Engineer can go for days and days**
**Describing how concrete's used in oh-so many ways,**
**But not till one dark gray night of true debauchery**
**Was using it to float a boat considered one of these!**

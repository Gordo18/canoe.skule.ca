To convert the rough cast canoe to a finished product the demolded canoe must be sanded down to remove imperfections caused by the mold. The canoe is then sanded until smooth to reduce drag in the water. A graphic design for the canoe is created and then stained onto the canoe using acid-based stains, multiple layers are used to create bold colours. Finally the canoe is sealed and completed.
